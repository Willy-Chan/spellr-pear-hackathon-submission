Spellr is an all-in-one software platform designed to help struggling kids read and write.

Despite dyslexia affecting an estimated 20% of children, current solutions (tutoring/screening) are unreasonably expensive and out of reach for many students and schools. 

Our team has prior experience in education research, and having witnessed this crisis we decided to build a software platform to fix it.

The core of our product is a software platform that syncs data across various dyslexia screening activities (writing, reading, and games) and, combined with inference from AI, we can provide a capable and inexpensive solution for anyone to get the tutoring they need!
